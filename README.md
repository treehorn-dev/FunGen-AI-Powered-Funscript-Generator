---

## Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation or need custom configuration:

### Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git** https://git-scm.com/downloads/ or 'winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget' from a command prompt for Windows users as described below for easy install of Miniconda.
- **FFmpeg** added to your PATH or specified under the settings menu (https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- **Miniconda** (https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)

Easy install of Miniconda for Windows users:
Open Command Prompt and run: `winget install -e --id Anaconda.Miniconda3`

### Start a miniconda command prompt
After installing Miniconda look for a program called "Anaconda prompt (miniconda3)" in the start menu (on Windows) and open it

### Create the necessary miniconda environment and activate it
```bash
conda create -n VRFunAIGen python=3.11
conda activate VRFunAIGen
```
- Please note that any pip or python commands related to this project must be run from within the VRFunAIGen virtual environment.

### Clone the repository
Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you'd like FunGen to be located. For example, if you want it in C:\FunGen, navigate to C:\ ('cd C:\'). Then run
```bash
git clone --branch main https://github.com/ack00gar/FunGen-AI-Powered-Funscript-Generator.git FunGen
cd FunGen
```

### Install the core python requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements/core.requirements.txt
```

### NVIDIA GPU Setup (CUDA Required)

**Quick Setup:**
1. **Install NVIDIA Drivers**: [Download here](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
2. **Install CUDA 12.8**: [Download here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
3. **Install cuDNN for CUDA 12.8**: [Download here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (requires free NVIDIA account)

**Install Python Packages:**

**For 20xx, 30xx and 40xx-series NVIDIA GPUs:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements/cuda.requirements.txt
pip install tensorrt
```

**For 50xx series NVIDIA GPUs (RTX 5070, 5080, 5090):**
```bash
pip install -r requirements/cuda.50series.requirements.txt
pip install tensorrt
```

**Note:** NVIDIA 10xx series GPUs are not supported.

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
nvidia-smi                    # Check GPU and driver
nvcc --version               # Check CUDA version  
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"  # Check PyTorch CUDA
python -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.cudnn.is_available())"  # Check cuDNN
```

### If your GPU doesn't support cuda
```bash
pip install -r requirements/cpu.requirements.txt
```

### AMD GPU acceleration (ROCm for Linux Only)
ROCm is supported for AMD GPUs on Linux. To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements/rocm.requirements.txt
```

## Download the YOLO models

The necessary YOLO models will be automatically downloaded on the first startup. If you want to use a specific model, you can download it from our Discord and place it in the `models/` sub-directory. If you aren't sure, you can add all the models and let the app decide the best option for you.

### Start the app
```bash
python main.py
```

We support multiple model formats across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Recommendations
- NVIDIA Cards: we recommend the .engine model
- AMD Cards: we recommend .pt (requires ROCm see below)
- Mac: we recommend .mlmodel

### Models
- **.pt (PyTorch)**: Requires CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs) or ROCm (for AMD GPUs) for acceleration.
- **.onnx (ONNX Runtime)**: Best for CPU users as it offers broad compatibility and efficiency.
- **.engine (TensorRT)**: For NVIDIA GPUs: Provides very significant efficiency improvements (this file needs to be build by running "Generate TensorRT.bat" after adding the base ".pt" model to the models directory)
- **.mlpackage (Core ML)**: Optimized for macOS users. Runs efficiently on Apple devices with Core ML.

In most cases, the app will automatically detect the best model from your models directory at launch, but if the right model wasn't present at this time or the right dependencies where not installed, you might need to override it under settings. The same applies when we release a new version of the model.


### Troubleshooting CUDA Installation

**Common Issues:**
- **Driver version mismatch**: Ensure NVIDIA drivers are compatible with your CUDA version
- **PATH issues**: Make sure CUDA bin directory is in your system PATH
- **Version conflicts**: Ensure all components (driver, CUDA, cuDNN, PyTorch) are compatible versions

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
nvidia-smi                    # Check GPU and driver
nvcc --version               # Check CUDA version  
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"  # Check PyTorch CUDA
python -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.cudnn.is_available())"  # Check cuDNN
```

## GUI

FunGen launches with a streamlined interface. The control panel (left) has Run and Metadata tabs, plus add-on tabs for Device Control, Streamer, and Batch Processing. The info panel (right) has Info, Settings, Undo, and Performance tabs. All settings are searchable from the Settings tab. Use View > Show Advanced Options to reveal developer controls.

# Docker CLI

The supported Docker workflow for this project is headless CLI only. There are two Dockerfiles:

- [Dockerfile.cli.cpu](Dockerfile.cli.cpu): CPU image for `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64`
- [Dockerfile.cli.cuda](Dockerfile.cli.cuda): NVIDIA CUDA image for `linux/amd64` only

### Build the image

**Build CPU for Apple Silicon / ARM64:**

```bash
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -f Dockerfile.cli.cpu -t fungen-cli:cpu-arm64 .
```

**Build CPU for x86_64 / AMD64:**

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile.cli.cpu -t fungen-cli:cpu-amd64 .
```

**Build NVIDIA CUDA for x86_64 / AMD64:**

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile.cli.cuda -t fungen-cli:cuda-amd64 .
```

### Check the CLI

```bash
docker run --rm -it fungen-cli:cpu-arm64 --help
```

### Run a single video

This example mounts an input video read-only and writes generated output to a local `output/` folder:

```bash
mkdir -p output
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/input:/data/input:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/data/output" \
  fungen-cli:cpu-arm64 \
  /data/input/video.mp4 --output /data/output
```

### Run a folder recursively

```bash
mkdir -p output
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/input:/data/input:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/data/output" \
  fungen-cli:cpu-arm64 \
  /data/input --recursive --output /data/output
```

### Example with explicit processing options

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/input:/data/input:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/data/output" \
  fungen-cli:cpu-arm64 \
  /data/input/video.mp4 \
  --mode 3-stage \
  --overwrite \
  --no-copy \
  --output /data/output
```

### Optional: persist downloaded assets and models

On first run, FunGen may download UI assets and AI model files. If you want those downloads to survive container deletion, mount persistent locations for them:

```bash
mkdir -p output cache/assets cache/models cache/ultralytics
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/input:/data/input:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/data/output" \
  -v "$(pwd)/cache/assets:/app/assets" \
  -v "$(pwd)/cache/models:/app/models" \
  -v "$(pwd)/cache/ultralytics:/app/config/ultralytics" \
  fungen-cli:cpu-arm64 \
  /data/input/video.mp4 --output /data/output
```

### Run with NVIDIA GPU on Linux

Use the CUDA image only on a Linux host with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed:

```bash
mkdir -p output cache/assets cache/models cache/ultralytics
docker run --rm -it --gpus all \
  -v "$(pwd)/input:/data/input:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/data/output" \
  -v "$(pwd)/cache/assets:/app/assets" \
  -v "$(pwd)/cache/models:/app/models" \
  -v "$(pwd)/cache/ultralytics:/app/config/ultralytics" \
  fungen-cli:cuda-amd64 \
  /data/input/video.mp4 --output /data/output
```

### Notes

- The container entrypoint is `python main.py`, so any CLI arguments after the image name are passed directly to FunGen.
- `Dockerfile.cli.cpu` is the portable default and works for both `arm64` and `amd64`.
- `Dockerfile.cli.cuda` is for `amd64` NVIDIA Linux hosts only.
- `--output /data/output` is the safest pattern in Docker because it keeps generated files on a mounted host directory.
- If you want to avoid repeated downloads, mount `/app/models`, `/app/assets`, and `/app/config/ultralytics` to persistent host directories.

# Command Line Usage

FunGen can be run in two modes: a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI) for automation and batch processing.

**To start the GUI**, simply run the script without any arguments:

```bash
python main.py
```

**To use the CLI mode**, you must provide an input path to a video or a folder.

### CLI Examples

**To generate a script for a single video with default settings:**

```bash
python main.py "/path/to/your/video.mp4"
```

**To process an entire folder of videos recursively using a specific mode and overwrite existing funscripts:**

```bash
python main.py "/path/to/your/folder" --mode <your_mode> --overwrite --recursive
```

**To run multiple instances on different GPUs (e.g. 10-bit on QSV, rest on CUDA):**

```bash
python main.py "/path/to/10bit_videos" --hwaccel qsv &
python main.py "/path/to/other_videos" --hwaccel cuda &
```

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `input_path` | | **Required for CLI mode.** Path to a single video file or a folder containing videos. |
| `--mode` | | Sets the processing mode. The available modes are discovered dynamically. |
| `--overwrite`| | Forces the app to re-process and overwrite any existing funscripts. By default, it skips videos that already have a funscript. |
| `--no-autotune`| | Disables the automatic application of Ultimate Autotune after generation. |
| `--no-copy` | | Prevents saving a copy of the final funscript next to the video file. It will only be saved in the application's output folder. |
| `--generate-roll` | | Generates a secondary axis funscript file (e.g. `.roll.funscript`) for supported multi-axis devices. |
| `--save-preprocessed` | | Keeps the preprocessed (resized/unwarped) video for each processed file. Off by default in batch/CLI to save disk space. |
| `--hwaccel` | | Override hardware acceleration method for this run (e.g. `cuda`, `qsv`, `auto`, `none`). Useful for running multiple instances on different GPUs. |
| `--recursive`| `-r` | If the input path is a folder, this flag enables scanning for videos in all its subdirectories. |

# Modular Systems

FunGen features a modular architecture for both funscript filtering and motion tracking, allowing for easy extension and customization.

## Filter Plugin System

Plugins are accessible from the **Plugins** dropdown in the timeline toolbar. Each plugin opens a popup with adjustable parameters and live preview. Available plugins:

- **Amplify:** Amplifies or reduces position values around a center point.
- **Autotune SG:** Automatically finds optimal Savitzky-Golay filter parameters.
- **Clamp:** Clamps all positions to a specific value.
- **Invert:** Inverts position values (0 becomes 100, etc.).
- **Keyframes:** Simplifies the script to significant peaks and valleys.
- **Resample:** Resamples the funscript at regular intervals while preserving peak timing.
- **Simplify (RDP):** Simplifies the funscript by removing redundant points using the RDP algorithm.
- **Smooth (SG):** Applies a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter.
- **Speed Limiter:** Limits speed and adds vibrations for hardware device compatibility.
- **Threshold Clamp:** Clamps positions to 0/100 based on thresholds.
- **Ultimate Autotune:** Comprehensive 8-stage enhancement pipeline with live preview.

## Tracking System

The tracker system is responsible for analyzing the video and generating the raw motion data. Trackers are organized into categories based on their functionality.

### Offline Trackers (Recommended)

- **VR Hybrid Chapter-Aware** - Single-pass chapter detection + per-chapter ROI optical flow. Best quality for VR videos.
- **Contact Analysis (2-Stage)** - YOLO-based contact detection and analysis.
- **Guided Flow (3-Stage)** - Chapter-aware dense optical flow with per-position ROI strategies.

### Live Trackers

- **2D POV and VR Hybrid Flow** - YOLO ROI detection with DIS optical flow. Dual axis (stroke + roll).
- **Oscillation Detector** - Grid-based motion detection with decay mechanism.
- **YOLO ROI Tracker** - Automatic ROI detection with optical flow.
- **User ROI Tracker** - Manual ROI definition with sub-tracking.

### Community Trackers

Community trackers are auto-discovered from the `tracker/tracker_modules/community/` folder. See the example tracker for how to create your own.

# Performance & Parallel Processing

Our pipeline's current bottleneck lies in the Python code within YOLO.track (the object detection library we use), which is challenging to parallelize effectively in a single process.

However, when you have high-performance hardware you can use the command line (see above) to processes multiple videos simultaneously. Alternatively you can launch multiple instances of the GUI.

We tested speeds of about 60 to 110 fps for 8k 8bit vr videos when running a single process. Which translates to faster then realtime processing already. However, running in parallel mode we tested
speeds of about 160 to 190 frames per second (for object detection). Meaning processing times of about 20 to 30 minutes for 8bit 8k VR videos for the complete process. More then twice the speed of realtime!

Keep in mind your results may vary as this is very dependent on your hardware. Cuda capable cards will have an advantage here. However, since the pipeline is largely CPU and video decode bottlenecked
a top of the line card like the 4090 is not required to get similar results. Having enough VRAM to run 3-6 processes, paired with a good CPU, will speed things up considerably though.

**Important considerations:**

- Each instance requires the YOLO model to load which means you'll need to keep checks on your VRAM to see how many you can load.
- The optimal number of instances depends on a combination of factors, including your CPU, GPU, RAM, and system configuration. So experiment with different setups to find the ideal configuration for your hardware! 😊

# Output Files

FunGen generates the following files in a dedicated subfolder within your output directory:

- **`.funscript`** - The final funscript file for the primary (stroke) axis
- **`.roll.funscript` / `.twist.funscript`** - Secondary axis funscript (if dual-axis tracker is used)
- **`_t1_raw.funscript`** - Raw unprocessed funscript before any post-processing
- **`_preprocessed.mkv`** - Preprocessed video for faster re-runs (optional, off by default)
- **`.fgnproj`** - FunGen project file containing settings, chapters, and metadata

# About the project

## Pipeline Overview

Each tracker implements its own pipeline. The VR Hybrid tracker (recommended) works as follows:

1.  **Chapter Detection** - Sparse YOLO detection at 2fps classifies the video into chapters (cowgirl, missionary, blowjob, etc.)
2.  **Per-Chapter Analysis** - Dense YOLO + ROI optical flow per chapter, with position-specific amplitude targets
3.  **Funscript Generation** - Motion signal smoothing, peak detection, and keyframe extraction
4.  **Optional Post-Processing** - Apply Ultimate Autotune or individual plugins from the timeline's Plugins menu

## Project Genesis and Evolution

This project started as a dream to automate Funscript generation for VR videos. Here’s a brief history of its development:

- **Initial Approach (OpenCV Trackers)**: The first version relied on OpenCV trackers to detect and track objects in the video. While functional, the approach was slow (8–20 FPS) and struggled with occlusions and complex scenes.
- **Transition to YOLO**: To improve accuracy and speed, the project shifted to using YOLO object detection. A custom YOLO model was trained on a dataset of 1000nds annotated VR video frames, significantly improving detection quality.
- **Original Post**: For more details and discussions, check out the original post on EroScripts:

# Troubleshooting

## Installation Issues

### "unknown@unknown" or Git Permission Errors

If you see `[unknown@unknown]` in the application logs or git errors like "returned non-zero exit status 128":

**Cause:** The installer was run with administrator privileges, causing git permission/ownership issues.

**Solution 1 - Fix git permissions:**
```cmd
cd "C:\path\to\your\FunGen\FunGen"
git config --add safe.directory .
```

**Solution 2 - Reinstall as normal user:**
1. Redownload `install.bat`
2. Run it as a **normal user** (NOT as administrator)
3. Use the launcher script created by the installer instead of `python main.py`

### FFmpeg/FFprobe Not Found

If you get "ffmpeg/ffprobe not found" errors:

1. **Use the launcher script** (`launch.bat` or `launch.sh`) instead of running `python main.py` directly
2. **Rerun the installer** to get updated launcher scripts with FFmpeg PATH fixes
3. The launcher automatically adds FFmpeg to PATH

### General Installation Problems

1. **Always use launcher scripts** - Don't run `python main.py` directly
2. **Run installer as normal user** - Avoid administrator mode
3. **Rerun installer for updates** - Get latest fixes by rerunning the installer
4. **Check working directory** - Make sure you're in the FunGen project folder
